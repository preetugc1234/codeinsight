Zipkin for visualization\n\n## Dashboards\n- System health dashboard\n- Service-specific dashboards\n- Real-time alerting\n\n## Alerts\n- Error rate > 1% → P1 incident\n- Latency p99 > 1s → P2 incident\n- CPU > 90% → P3 incident\n- Disk usage > 85% → P3 incident\n\n## SLOs & Error Budgets\n- Availability SLO: 99.99% (4.32 minutes downtime/month)\n- Latency SLO: 99% of requests < 500ms\n- Error budget: 0.01% (consume over 30 days)\n\n# 💰 Cost Optimization\n\n## Current Monthly Cost\n- Compute: $X\n- Database: $X\n- Storage: $X\n- Network: $X\n- Total: $X\n\n## Optimization Strategies\n\n### Compute\n- Use spot instances for batch jobs (70% savings)\n- Right-size instances based on utilization\n- Reserved instances for stable workloads (40% savings)\n- Auto-scaling to avoid over-provisioning\n\n### Database\n- Connection pooling to reduce connections\n- Read replicas only when needed\n- Archive old data to cheaper storage\n- Query optimization to reduce CPU\n\n### Storage\n- S3 lifecycle policies: Standard → IA → Glacier\n- Compress images and assets\n- CDN caching to reduce origin requests\n\n### Network\n- CloudFront CDN to reduce data transfer\n- Compression (gzip/brotli)\n- Optimize API payloads\n\n## Cost Monitoring\n- Set budget alerts\n- Track cost per customer\n- Optimize based on unit economics\n\n# 🚀 Deployment & DevOps\n\n## CI/CD Pipeline\n\n```bash\n# Development → Staging → Production\n\n1. Commit → Git push\n2. CI runs: Lint, test, build\n3. Create Docker image\n4. Push to registry\n5. Deploy to staging\n6. Run integration tests\n7. Manual approval\n8. Canary deployment to prod (5%)\n9. Monitor for 1 hour\n10. Gradual rollout (5% → 25% → 100%)\n```\n\n## Infrastructure as Code\n- Terraform for infrastructure\n- Helm charts for Kubernetes\n- Version control all configs\n- Automated provisioning\n\n## Deployment Strategy\n\n### Blue-Green Deployment\n- Zero downtime deployments\n- Instant rollback capability\n\n### Canary Deployment\n- 5% of traffic to new version\n- Monitor error rates and latency\n- Gradual rollout if metrics are good\n- Automatic rollback if errors spike\n\n### Feature Flags\n- LaunchDarkly / custom system\n- Enable features for specific users\n- A/B testing capabilities\n- Kill switch for problematic features\n\n## Rollback Strategy\n\n```bash\n# If deployment fails:\n1. Automatic rollback after 3 health check failures\n2. Manual rollback: ./deploy.sh rollback\n3. Database migrations: use backward-compatible changes\n4. Post-mortem within 24 hours\n```\n\n# 🎯 Migration Strategy\n\n## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)\n- Setup infrastructure\n- Deploy core services\n- Migrate users in read-only mode\n\n## Phase 2: Parallel Run (Week 3-4)\n- Run old and new systems side-by-side\n- Dual writes to both systems\n- Compare results for accuracy\n\n## Phase 3: Gradual Migration (Week 5-8)\n- 10% traffic to new system\n- 50% traffic to new system\n- 100% traffic to new system\n- Monitor closely at each step\n\n## Phase 4: Cleanup (Week 9-10)\n- Decommission old system\n- Data validation\n- Performance tuning\n\n# 🌍 Multi-Region Strategy\n\n## Active-Active (if applicable)\n- Deploy to multiple regions (us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-south-1)\n- Global load balancing (Route53 / CloudFlare)\n- Data replication: eventual consistency\n- Conflict resolution strategy\n\n## Active-Passive (if simpler)\n- Primary region: us-east-1\n- Backup region: eu-west-1\n- Failover time: < 15 minutes\n\n# 📚 Technical Debt & Future Improvements\n\n## Short-term (0-3 months)\n- Improve test coverage to 80%\n- Add distributed tracing\n- Optimize database queries\n\n## Medium-term (3-12 months)\n- Migrate to microservices\n- Implement event sourcing\n- Add GraphQL API\n\n## Long-term (1-2 years)\n- Multi-region deployment\n- Real-time collaboration features\n- AI/ML model serving infrastructure",
