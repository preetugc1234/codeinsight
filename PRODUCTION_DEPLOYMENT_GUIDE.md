# ðŸš€ Production Deployment Guide - UPDATED

## âœ… All Production URLs Configured!

Your services are now configured to use production endpoints:

### Production URLs:
- **Frontend**: https://codeinsight4.vercel.app
- **Java API Gateway**: https://codeinsight-java-api.onrender.com
- **Python Worker**: https://codeinsight-python-worker.onrender.com

---

## ðŸ“‹ What Was Fixed

### Problem:
- Services were using localhost URLs
- API key generation failed
- Extension couldn't authenticate
- Routes not working in production

### Solution Applied:
âœ… Java API now points to production Python worker
âœ… Frontend now points to production Java API
âœ… Extension now points to production Java API
âœ… All code committed and pushed (commit: 6bd3c17)

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Java API to Render

#### Option A: Auto-Deploy (Recommended)
1. Go to Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your `codeinsight-java-api` service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait for build to complete (~5 minutes)

#### Option B: Set Environment Variable
If you want to override the Python worker URL:
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Click `codeinsight-java-api` service
3. Go to "Environment" tab
4. Add variable:
   - **Key**: `PYTHON_WORKER_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://codeinsight-python-worker.onrender.com`
5. Save and redeploy

### Step 2: Deploy Python Worker to Render

1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Find `codeinsight-python-worker` service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait for deployment (~3 minutes)

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

#### Update Environment Variables in Vercel:
1. Go to Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find `codeinsight4` project
3. Go to "Settings" â†’ "Environment Variables"
4. Update these variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = https://codeinsight-java-api.onrender.com
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL = wss://codeinsight-java-api.onrender.com/ws
   ```
5. Click "Save"
6. Go to "Deployments" tab
7. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment

**OR** just push to main (Vercel auto-deploys):
```bash
# Already done! Just wait for Vercel to deploy
```

### Step 4: Publish Extension Update

Your extension v1.0.1 is ready but needs re-authentication:

#### Re-login to VS Code Marketplace:
```bash
# Login again with fresh PAT token
npx vsce login code-insight

# When prompted, paste your PAT token from Azure DevOps
# (Go to: https://dev.azure.com â†’ User Settings â†’ Personal Access Tokens)
```

#### Then publish:
```bash
cd vscode-extension
npx vsce publish
```

## âœ… Verification Steps

### Test 1: Check Services are Running

```bash
# Test Java API
curl https://codeinsight-java-api.onrender.com/health
# Should return: {"status": "healthy"}

# Test Python Worker
curl https://codeinsight-python-worker.onrender.com/health
# Should return: {"status": "healthy", "service": "python-worker"}

# Test Frontend
curl https://codeinsight4.vercel.app
# Should return: HTML page
```

### Test 2: Test API Key Generation

1. Go to: https://codeinsight4.vercel.app/dashboard/settings
2. Sign in
3. Click "Regenerate" button
4. Should see: "âœ“ New API key generated and copied to clipboard!"
5. API key format: `sk_ci_abc123...`

### Test 3: Test Authentication Endpoint

```bash
# Get your API key from dashboard first, then:
curl https://codeinsight-java-api.onrender.com/api/auth/whoami \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_ci_YOUR_KEY_HERE"

# Should return:
# {
#   "success": true,
#   "user_id": "...",
#   "email": "...",
#   "plan": "trial",
#   "is_authenticated": true,
#   "auth_method": "api_key"
# }
```

### Test 4: Test Extension in Cursor

1. Open Cursor IDE
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Extensions)
3. Search `code-insight2`
4. Update to v1.0.1 (or wait for auto-update)
5. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
6. Type "Code Insight: Set API Key"
7. Paste API key from dashboard
8. Should see: "âœ“ API key saved successfully"
9. Open any code file
10. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ "Code Insight: Review Current File"
11. Should work! ðŸŽ‰
