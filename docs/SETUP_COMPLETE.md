## 🔧 What You Need to Deploy

### Deploy Frontend (if not already)
```bash
# Frontend should be deployed to Vercel or similar
# Make sure environment variables are set:
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL (your Java gateway URL)
```

### Deploy Java API Gateway
```bash
# Make sure Java gateway is running and pointing to:
# - Python worker URL
# - MongoDB connection
# - Redis connection
```

### Deploy Python Worker
```bash
# Make sure Python worker has:
# - All new authentication endpoints
# - api/auth.py with /whoami endpoint
# - api/api_keys.py with /generate endpoint
# - services/supabase_service.py
#
# Code is already pushed (commit: e45a20b, 9433539)
# Just redeploy from your platform
```

---

## 🧪 Testing the Full Flow

### Test 1: API Key Generation (Dashboard)
```bash
# 1. Open dashboard
# 2. Go to Settings
# 3. Click "Regenerate"
# 4. Should see: "✓ New API key generated and copied to clipboard!"
# 5. API key format: sk_ci_abc123...
```

### Test 2: Extension Authentication
```bash
# 1. Install extension from marketplace
# 2. Set API key (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Code Insight: Set API Key")
# 3. Extension validates with /api/auth/whoami
# 4. Should see: "✓ API key saved successfully"
# 5. No "invalid API key" error
```

### Test 3: Code Review
```bash
# 1. Open any code file
# 2. Press Ctrl+Shift+P → "Code Insight: Review Current File"
# 3. Should see: "⏳ Analyzing code..." status
# 4. Wait for AI analysis
# 5. Should see: Review results in panel
```

### Test 4: Backend Endpoint
```bash
# Test /api/auth/whoami endpoint directly
curl https://your-api-url.com/api/auth/whoami \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_ci_your_test_key"

# Expected response (if key valid):
{
  "success": true,
  "user_id": "abc-123-def-456",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "plan": "lite",
  "tokens_remaining": 195000,
  "is_authenticated": true,
  "auth_method": "api_key"
}

# Expected response (if key invalid):
{
  "detail": "Invalid authentication token. Please use a valid API key or JWT."
}
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "API key invalid" in extension
**Cause**: Backend not deployed or /whoami endpoint not working
**Fix**:
```bash
# Test endpoint:
curl https://your-api-url.com/api/auth/whoami \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer test"

# Should return 401 (not 404)
# If 404, backend not deployed correctly
```

### Issue 2: "Failed to generate API key" in dashboard
**Cause**: Java gateway not routing to Python worker
**Fix**:
- Check Java gateway logs
- Verify `app.python-worker.url` in application.properties
- Test Python worker directly: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/keys/generate`

### Issue 3: Extension timeout on code review
**Cause**: Java gateway not connecting to Python worker
**Fix**:
- Check Java gateway → Python worker connection
- Verify Redis and MongoDB connections
- Check Python worker is running

### Issue 4: SQL migration errors
**Cause**: Table already exists or permissions issue
**Fix**:
- Drop existing table: `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS api_keys CASCADE;`
- Re-run migration SQL
- Check Supabase role permissions
