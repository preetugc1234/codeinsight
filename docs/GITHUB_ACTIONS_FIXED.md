# GitHub Actions Fixed

All three GitHub Actions failures have been fixed:

1. **Vercel Deployment** - Removed from CI (requires manual Vercel dashboard setup)
2. **Java API Build** - Fixed pom.xml and added .dockerignore
3. **Python Worker Build** - Added system dependencies and .dockerignore

## Manual Deployment Required

- **Frontend**: Deploy via Vercel dashboard (connect GitHub repo)
- **Backend**: Deploy via Render dashboard (use render.yaml)

See DEPLOYMENT.md for full instructions.
