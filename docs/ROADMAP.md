| Token costs too high | Prompt compression, strict budgets |
| Database overload | Connection pooling, indexes, caching |

### Time Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Feature creep | Stick to MVP, defer nice-to-haves |
| Debugging time | Set time limits, move on if stuck |
| Integration issues | Test early and often |

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **Test continuously** - Don't wait until the end
2. **Deploy early** - Find issues in production environment
3. **Use caching aggressively** - Saves time and money
4. **Keep prompts short** - Reduces token costs
5. **Monitor everything** - Catch issues before users do
6. **Ship imperfect** - You can improve after launch
