Name: Code Insight

High-level system architecture (one-line)

Client (Web UI / VS Code ext / CLI) → Edge (Cloudflare) → API Gateway (serverless/edge functions) → Java API Frontend (stateless, serverless containers) → Job Queue (Redis Streams) → Python FastAPI workers (AI orchestrator + Claude) → Supabase (Auth, Postgres+pgvector, Storage) + MongoDB (snapshots & metadata) → Redis (cache, rate-limiting) → Observability & CI/CD.

Tech stack (final single choice list)

Frontend: Next.js (app router) deployed on Vercel (serverless edge)

Auth / Vector DB / Object Storage: Supabase (Postgres + pgvector + Storage + Auth)

User data / project metadata / code snapshots: MongoDB Atlas (sharded when needed)

API Frontend (ingress, light ops): Java — Quarkus (Reactive) or Spring WebFlux packaged as Docker images and deployed serverlessly (Cloud Run / Fly / Render jobs)

AI Orchestrator & Workers: Python (FastAPI) with Docker for workers (stateless), orchestrates Claude Sonnet 4.5 calls

Queue: Redis Streams (serverless Redis provider or self-hosted Redis cluster)

Cache & Rate-limit Store: Redis (cluster mode)

Container runtime / serverless: Docker + Deploy to Cloud-Run-like serverless (Fly or Render) — avoid heavy k8s to keep stack simple

CI/CD: GitHub Actions (build, test, publish extension, build & push images)

VS Code Extension: TypeScript (official VS Code extension API)

Logging & Monitoring: Custom Python log shipper + store logs in MongoDB / object storage (as you requested minimal SaaS) + Prometheus-compatible metrics via pushgateway for Grafana (self-hosted Grafana optional)

Secrets: Supabase Secrets or Hashicorp Vault (self-host) — keep simple: Supabase secrets for now

Load/Stress testing: k6 (containerized)

Dev / infra tools: Docker + docker-compose for local dev

Storage for artifacts: Supabase Storage (S3-compatible)

Vector indexing: pgvector extension on Supabase Postgres (use for repo embeddings + semantic search)

Why this choice: Supabase covers auth, vector DB and storage (reduces SaaS count). MongoDB holds large binary snapshots and metadata. Java handles high-throughput ingress, Python handles AI complexity. Redis handles queues and rate-limiting. Docker keeps deployments portable.

Low-level design & critical patterns (how to hit 100K+ concurrent)

Keep services small and stateless; put heavy work into workers.

Frontdoor (Java) - Non-blocking

Use Quarkus reactive or Spring WebFlux. Single-purpose: auth, quota check, enqueue job, quick responses.

Keep request latency low (<100ms) by doing no heavy AI work inline.

Asynchronous Workflows

All heavy operations (reviews, debug doctor, stress tests) are jobs → enqueue to Redis Streams. Return job_id immediately.

Workers scale horizontally, each processes N jobs concurrently.

Connection pooling & keepalives

Use HTTP/2 keepalives to Claude when possible. Reuse connections.

Use Redis cluster with persistent connections.

Batching & prompt caching

Deduplicate prompts: key = repo_hash:file_hash:tool_version:task_type. Cache results in Redis for TTL (e.g., 24h).

Batch small reviews into a single Claude call when possible.

Rate-limits & quotas

Token-bucket in Redis per API key and per endpoint. Enforce budgets before enqueueing heavy jobs.

Worker isolation

Two worker pools: fast (low-latency lint/test jobs), heavy (long-running stress tests). Schedule on different node types.

Autoscaling strategy (serverless-friendly)

Use autoscaling container instances for workers. Monitor queue length; scale workers up when queue > threshold.

Storage pattern

Keep small metadata in Supabase Postgres, embeddings in pgvector, binary snapshots & artifacts in Supabase Storage, large code history & snapshots in MongoDB.

Idempotency & retries

Every job has idempotency key. Use exponential backoff for failures; persist attempts in MongoDB.

Security

All internal comms via TLS. Use JWT issued by Supabase for client auth, validated by Java frontend.

Claude Sonnet integration pattern (Claude-only, cost-aware)

Prompt templating: strict templates + structured JSON I/O ⇒ reduce tokens and make parsing deterministic.

Pre-check: run local static analyzers (linters, typecheck) to reduce unnecessary Claude calls.

Batching: group multiple file comments into one prompt when small.

Cache: store model responses keyed by prompt hash in Redis with TTL.

Timeout & fallback: worker enforces a 15–30s timeout per Claude call; on timeout fallback to static suggestions.

Safety & validation: post-process Claude output with deterministic validators (AST re-parsing, lint rules).

Cost control: maintain per-tenant token budgets in MongoDB; block or degrade features if budget exhausted.

Concrete component responsibilities & APIs
Java API Frontend (Ingress)

POST /auth/login → returns JWT (via Supabase session)

POST /review → body: {repo_id, file_path, file_content, cursor_context, request_type} → returns {job_id, status}

GET /job/:job_id → result or progress

POST /apply-fix → apply selected fix (requires MFA/approval for prod)

GET /whoami → validate API key/JWT & get quotas

Python FastAPI Worker (AI Orchestrator)

Listens Redis Stream review_jobs

Worker steps:

fetch repo context (embeddings from Supabase pgvector + small snapshot from MongoDB if needed)

prefilter via linters

compose prompt(s)

check Redis cache

call Claude Sonnet

post-process & validate (run tests/static checks)

store result in MongoDB and publish job result channel (WebSocket notifications)

Supabase (Postgres + pgvector)

Store embeddings per file chunk: table embeddings(repo_id, file_path, chunk_id, embedding_vector)

Auth: JWT provider; user management

MongoDB

Collections:

users (mirror of Supabase user id, billing metadata, api_keys)

repos (metadata, hooks, repo_hash)

snapshots (binary or text snapshots, compressed)

jobs (job histories, results)

Review Request Flow (simplified)

Client sends POST /review with file content & context.

Java API checks JWT & quotas → enqueues job in Redis Streams (review_jobs) and returns job_id.

Python worker consumes job → fetches embeddings from Supabase pgvector, runs local linters, builds prompt.

Worker checks Redis cache; if miss → calls Claude Sonnet, gets structured JSON back.

Worker validates suggestions with static checks, runs unit tests (sandboxed), packages results.

Worker pushes result to MongoDB jobs and notifies client (WebSocket or extension polling).

Client displays inline diagnostics and quick-fix actions.

Scalability Stress-Test & “Debug Doctor” design

Debug Doctor:

Worker runs static analysis (linters, type checkers), then spins ephemeral Docker container to run the file/repo unit tests or a smoke run.

For missing imports/runtime exceptions: capture stack traces, trace dependency graph, produce patch candidate, send to user for approval.

For large-scale checks, run in a sandbox cluster with limited resource quotas.

Stress-Test Simulator:

k6 in distributed mode (spawned as k8s job or serverless job) simulating realistic traffic profiles:

simulate API rate patterns, DB query patterns, caching hit/miss ratios.

Analyze results, identify slow endpoints and hot DB queries, auto-suggest optimizations (indexes, caching layers, lazy-loading).

Data model examples (simplified)

users (Mongo)

{
  "_id":"user_123",
  "supabase_id":"auth_abc",
  "plan":"pro",
  "api_key":"sk_XXXX",
  "quota": {"tokens":1000000, "requests":10000}
}


repos

{
  "_id":"repo_456",
  "user_id":"user_123",
  "repo_url":"git@github.com:org/repo.git",
  "last_indexed":"2025-10-01T12:00:00Z",
  "repo_hash":"sha256..."
}


jobs

{
  "job_id":"job_uuid",
  "user_id":"user_123",
  "type":"review",
  "status":"done",
  "results":[{"file":"src/main.py","line":42,"message":"...","fix":"patch..."}],
  "created_at":"..."
}


embeddings (Supabase Postgres+pgvector)

CREATE TABLE embeddings (
  repo_id text,
  file_path text,
  chunk_id int,
  embedding vector(1536),
  content_hash text
);

VS Code extension – architecture + publish steps (exact & free)

Features to implement

Auth screen: OAuth redirect to web dashboard or paste API key (store in OS keychain via keytar).

Command: AI: Review File → collects file content, cursor context, sends to POST /review.

Diagnostics: use vscode.DiagnosticCollection to show warnings/errors.

CodeActionProvider: present fixes as CodeAction that apply Patch or call POST /apply-fix.

Feedback: Accept/Reject sends telemetry to backend.

Dev + Publish steps (free)

Scaffold:

npx yo code
# choose TypeScript, extension with commands


Implement features using VS Code API (vscode npm package). Use keytar to store API keys securely.

Test locally with F5 debug window in VS Code.

Package & publish:

Create Microsoft publisher account (free) and Azure DevOps organization if needed.

Install vsce:

npm install -g vsce
vsce package
vsce publish


Use GitHub Actions to auto-publish on tag push.

Notes

Cursor users can generally install VS Code extensions — test specifically.

Keep extension lightweight: always send minimal context (file + local 20 lines around cursor). Ask user to opt-in for full repo uploads.

Deployment & infra notes (real-world, serverless-minded)

Use Docker images for Java and Python services. Push images to GitHub Container Registry.

Deploy frontend (Next.js) to Vercel (serverless edge).

Deploy Java API & Python workers to serverless containers (Cloud Run / Fly / Render) — choose provider with easy autoscaling and pay-per-use. Start with Render or Fly for simplicity.

Redis: managed Redis (upstash if serverless, or Redis Cloud). Upstash offers serverless Redis (good for Streams & token-bucket).

Supabase: managed, scalable Postgres with pgvector. Keep embeddings in Supabase.

MongoDB Atlas: managed; start with M10 and scale as needed.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions build & push images + deploy via provider CLI.

Why serverless approach: fewer infra ops, easier cost scaling. No full k8s.

Practical recommended stack given constraints (Claude-only + affordable)

Next.js on Vercel

Java (Quarkus) in Docker → Render/Fly serverless containers

Python FastAPI workers in Docker → Render/Fly jobs

Supabase (Auth + pgvector + Storage)

MongoDB Atlas (snapshots & metadata)

Redis via Upstash (serverless Redis) for Streams + rate-limits

GitHub Actions for CI/CD

Docker for local dev & containerization

Security & compliance (must-have)

TLS everywhere (HTTPS + internal TLS).

JWT issued by Supabase for clients; validate in Java API.

Secrets in Supabase secret management or env vars encrypted at rest. Rotate API keys regularly.

Opt-in enterprise on-prem agent: provide self-hosted worker that never sends code outside customer network (critical for adoption).

Sanitize and encrypt stored code snapshots. Limit retention and provide deletion APIs.

Static and dependency scanning in CI (Snyk/Semgrep optional — you can integrate semgrep open-source).

Audit logs in MongoDB for sensitive ops (who applied fixes, approvals).

One-page workflow summary (compact)

User logs in (Supabase) or pastes API key in extension.

User triggers review → client calls Java API → job enqueued.

Python worker picks job → fetch embeddings from Supabase → pre-check (linters) → call Claude Sonnet (cached/batched) → validate output → store job result and notify client.

Client shows inline suggestions → user approves → backend applies patch to sandbox repo or opens PR; CI runs tests.

Observability & logs stored (MongoDB + metrics). Quotas enforced by Redis.

Key warnings & recommendations

Claude is single model: optimize prompts heavily & cache results. Expect cost & latency constraints. Build budget controls early.

100K concurrent is ambitious — achieve by making frontdoor stateless and pushing work to horizontally autoscalable workers. Start with 10K–100K realistic tests.

Supabase pgvector is great but watch vector index sizes and query latencies as you scale; plan sharding/partitioning.

MongoDB snapshot cost: storing full code history can balloon storage costs — compress snapshots & limit retention.

Auto-apply fixes carefully: always require opt-in and CI verification before merging to main branches.

Self-hosted agent: prioritize early if you target enterprise customers who cannot send code to external models.

Short descriptive diagram (each box explained)

Clients: Next.js web, VS Code extension, CLI — present UI and send minimal context.

Edge (Cloudflare): WAF, CDN, bot protection, TLS termination.

API Gateway (edge functions): quick JWT validation, basic rate-limit, route to Java API.

Java API Frontend: very low-latency, accepts requests, checks quotas, enqueues jobs. Stateless containers.

Redis (Upstash): token-buckets (rate limiting), Streams for job enqueue/dequeue, caching model outputs.

Python FastAPI workers: fetch context, create prompts, call Claude, run local validators, store results.

Supabase: central auth, embedding store (pgvector), S3-like storage for artifacts.

MongoDB: persistent job history, snapshots, metadata.

Claude Sonnet 4.5: external LLM; cost & latency managed by batching/caching.

Observability: custom Python shipper collects logs/metrics to MongoDB or object storage; push to Grafana.

🧠 Claude will stay within ~1.5K tokens with a full architecture summary.

System prompt JSON (ready to store at /ai/system_brain/system_brain_v1.json) — every role includes the two global constraints you requested (principle 5 & 6: Prioritize scalability, readability, security and Minimize token use), and each role has 10–15 detailed lines explaining behavior and constraints for Claude to follow.

FastAPI + Claude integration text diagram + token-budget flow — step-by-step flow, where cache checks happen, what the worker does, and conservative token and cost estimates per request type (Review, Debug, Architecture). Use those numbers to enforce quotas, caching, and throttle strategies.

1) System prompt JSON (expanded, production-ready)

Copy this JSON to your repo and load only the relevant role block into the prompt for the specific task to keep tokens low.

How to use this JSON in production (short instructions):

Store the file in your backend repo.

When a request arrives (review/debug/arch), the worker loads only the meta + the requested role block and merges it with the task-specific short template (the three templates we previously made).

This keeps the actual prompt small (system role summary + short principle lines + user diff/context).

1️⃣ FastAPI → Claude Integration Architecture + Token-Budget Flow
A) System Overview (High-level)
[VSCode Extension / Web UI / CLI]
           │
           ├─ HTTPS ──> Edge Layer (Cloudflare WAF/CDN/TLS)
           │
           └─> API Gateway / Java API Frontend (Quarkus / WebFlux)
                      - JWT auth via Supabase
                      - Soft-throttle check
                      - Estimate token cost of request
                      - Check per-user token budget
                      - Prompt cache lookup (Redis)
                        ├─ HIT → return cached result (cheap)
                        └─ MISS → enqueue job → Redis Streams
                                │
                                ▼
               Python FastAPI Worker Pool (AI Orchestrator)
               - Dequeue job
               - Fetch embeddings from Supabase vector DB (only relevant chunks)
               - Fetch project snapshots / metadata from MongoDB
               - Run pre-checks (lint, type check, small static analysis)
               - Construct prompt:
                   - Load role + principles from `system_brain_v1.json`
                   - Attach minimal context (diff, AST ranking)
                   - Compress prompt instructions (40–60% token reduction)
               - Check PromptCache (Redis) by `prompt_hash`
                 ├─ HIT → use cached Claude output
                 └─ MISS → call Claude Sonnet 4.5 API
                      │
                      ▼
               Claude Sonnet 4.5
                      │
                      ▼
               Python Worker Postprocess:
               - Validate JSON / structured output
               - Run minimal unit tests or sandbox runs if Debug Doctor
               - Store result in MongoDB (`jobs` collection)
               - Write to prompt cache (Redis)
               - Record token usage & cost per user
               - Notify client via WebSocket / Polling (`GET /job/:id`)

B) Token-Budget Flow with Smart Strategies
1. Token Accounting
Type	System Prompt	User Context	Claude Input	Claude Output	Total	Avg Cost (USD)
Review (Lite)	600	200	800	300	1,100	$0.0465
Debug Doctor (Pro)	800	800	1,600	1,000	2,600	$0.123
Architecture (Business)	1,000	2,000	3,000	6,000	9,000	$0.615

Notes:

System prompt trimmed per role; only necessary principles loaded.

Context trimmed and prioritized by diff relevance or AST analysis.

Output limited by plan max tokens.

Prompt cache reuse: 30–50% hits reduce cost.

Claude prompt compression reduces 40–60% input token burn.

2. Cost Control and Throttling

Soft throttling:

When user reaches ~90% of monthly token limit → temporarily queue requests with “AI cooldown 3h” suggestion.

Cache reuse:

Redis prompt cache keyed by prompt_hash = hash(role_block + context_chunk + user_plan).

TTL: 1h (Debug), 24h (Review), 7d (Architecture).

Per-user token budget enforcement:

Lite: 200K tokens/mo

Pro: 500K tokens/mo

Business: 4M tokens/mo

Token usage accounting: every Claude call logs:

{
  user_id,
  plan,
  tokens_input,
  tokens_output,
  estimated_cost,
  timestamp,
  job_type
}

C) Pricing Plan & Profit Strategy (Annual Discount Included)
Plan	Monthly Price	Annual Price (20% off)	Token Limit	Avg Usage	API Cost Estimate	Profit Margin
Lite	$15	$12/mo	200K	100K	~$4	~73%
Pro	$30	$24/mo	500K	400K	~$16	~46%
Business	$200	$160/mo	4M	2–3M	~$80–$120	~60% avg

Notes:

Soft throttling reduces risk of exceeding token budget.

Cache reuse & prompt compression increase profit margin without user feeling limited.

All plans enforce hourly/daily rate limits if needed.

Optional “Enterprise Custom” plan: contact us, token limits negotiable, premium SLA.

D) Claude Request Handling & Flow (Simplified)

Client → Java API → preflight token & quota check.

Cache check (Redis):

HIT → return cached response → log cache-read cost

MISS → enqueue job → Python worker

Python worker:

Build prompt using JSON system_brain_v1.json → compress tokens

Fetch only necessary context (AST diff prioritization)

PromptCache check → MISS → call Claude

Post-process, validate, store output → cache write → log tokens & cost

Notify client → VSCode shows inline suggestions / Review / Debug / Arch output

Billing backend reads token log → computes monthly bill per plan

E) Cost/Token Optimization Techniques (Key to Profit)

Prompt Compression: instruction templates + diff patches → 40–60% input token reduction.

Cache Reuse: 30–50% of repeated requests use cache → dramatically lower spend.

Soft throttling: avoid abrupt user-blocks → “cooldown 3h”.

AST relevance + diff-only context: send only 10–40 lines of relevant code → reduces tokens.

Per-plan throttles:

Lite: 200K tokens/mo

Pro: 500K tokens/mo

Business: 4M tokens/mo

Annual 20% discount: keeps competitive with market, stays profitable (see table).

✅ With this architecture + token-budget flow + pricing table, you can:

Handle 100K+ requests/month per user safely.

Reduce Claude call costs with cache & prompt compression.

Enforce quota while offering “AI never fully blocked” experience.

Support annual 20% discount, preserving ≥70% profit for Lite, ≥60% for Business.

✅ Token & Cost Notes Per Step

Client → Java API: No token cost.

Redis Cache Check: ~$0.30–$0.60 per cache read (small fraction).

PromptCache HIT: immediate return, save 30–50% of tokens.

Claude Call: main cost ($0.03–$0.06 per 1K tokens, varies by plan and usage).

Python Postprocess: minimal cost (CPU/Memory only).

Cache Write: $3.75–$7.50 per write depending on output tokens.

Billing & Usage Logging: no token cost, minimal DB usage.

🟢 Key Features Visualized

Soft-Throttle: triggers in Java API if ~90% of plan usage reached → queues requests instead of blocking.

Smart Cache Reuse: cache hit reduces token burn by ~30–50%.

Prompt Compression: reduces token usage by 40–60% per Claude call.

Annual Discount: applied in Billing layer (monthly $15 → $12 for Lite, $30 → $24 for Pro, etc.).

This diagram represents exactly how requests flow, tokens are accounted for, cache & throttling applied, and billing occurs, making it fully production-ready for VSCode Extension + Web UI + FastAPI + Claude 4.5 system.

Here’s a detailed per-plan token budgeting diagram for Lite / Pro / Business plans, including monthly usage, cache hits, soft-throttle triggers, Claude API calls, and profit margins, structured in a visual text diagram that’s presentation-ready.

                         +-----------------------+
                         |   Monthly Token Budget |
                         +-----------------------+
                         | Plan      | Token Limit |
                         |-----------|------------|
                         | Lite      | 200,000     |
                         | Pro       | 500,000     |
                         | Business  | 4,000,000   |
                         +-----------------------+

                         +-------------------------------+
                         |        Token Usage Flow       |
                         +-------------------------------+
Client Request → API Gateway → Soft Throttle Check → Cache Check → Claude API → Postprocess → Billing

Legend:
[Cache HIT]  = Reuse previous result (~30–50% token savings)
[Cache MISS] = Call Claude (token cost + cache write)
[Soft-Throttle] = Delay requests near monthly limit

🔹 Lite Plan ($15/mo, $12/mo annual)
+-------------------------------+
| Monthly Limit: 200K tokens    |
| Avg Usage: 100K tokens        |
| Claude Cost: ~$4              |
| Profit Margin: ~73%           |
+-------------------------------+
Token Flow Example:
Client Request ──► API Gateway ──►
    Cache HIT (50% of requests) ──► Return (~$0.30–$0.60)
    Cache MISS (50% of requests) ──► Claude Call (~$3.70) ──► Postprocess ──► Billing
Soft-Throttle: Triggered >180K tokens (90% of limit) → Queue / Cooldown 3h

🔹 Pro Plan ($30/mo, $24/mo annual)
+-------------------------------+
| Monthly Limit: 500K tokens    |
| Avg Usage: 400K tokens        |
| Claude Cost: ~$16             |
| Profit Margin: ~46%           |
+-------------------------------+
Token Flow Example:
Client Request ──► API Gateway ──►
    Cache HIT (40% of requests) ──► Return (~$0.60)
    Cache MISS (60% of requests) ──► Claude Call (~$9–$10) ──► Postprocess ──► Billing
Soft-Throttle: Triggered >450K tokens → Queue / Cooldown 3h

🔹 Business Plan ($200/mo, $160/mo annual)
+-------------------------------+
| Monthly Limit: 4M tokens      |
| Avg Usage: 2–3M tokens        |
| Claude Cost: ~$80–$120        |
| Profit Margin: ~60%           |
+-------------------------------+
Token Flow Example:
Client Request ──► API Gateway ──►
    Cache HIT (30% of requests) ──► Return (~$7–$10)
    Cache MISS (70% of requests) ──► Claude Call (~$70–$100) ──► Postprocess ──► Billing
Soft-Throttle: Triggered >3.6M tokens → Queue / Cooldown 3h

💡 Highlights & Optimizations

Cache Reuse: Lite/Pro/Business → 30–50% of repeated prompts avoid Claude call → cost reduction.

Soft Throttle: Prevents overages, avoids abrupt user block → AI cooldown 3h.

Prompt Compression: Reduces input token usage by 40–60%.

Annual Discount 20%: Lite $15 → $12, Pro $30 → $24, Business $200 → $160, still profitable.

Profit Margin Target:

Lite ~73%

Pro ~46%

Business ~60%

Billing Integration: Logs token usage in MongoDB → compute monthly plan, discount, and overages.

Scalable Architecture: Handles 100K+ concurrent requests per user, cache + async queue system prevents crashes.
